<h1>About Us</h1>

<p class="lead">
	It's a place you can post links and questions for a discussion with like-minded
    developers.
</p>

<p>
	The aim is to become a go-to site for developers to come and ask open questions 
    as well as links to some great content you have found (or even made).  Think
    Stackoverflow, but built for discussion and links instead of questions and answers.
</p>

<p>
	We're looking to move into other areas in the future, but at the moment it is 
    web development and programming only unfortunately.
