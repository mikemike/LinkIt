# LinkIt.io

First and foremost, this is a Reddit clone.  It was built as a personal tool where multiple sub-sites could be set up to share links.  Links can be manually posted, but generally they would be harvested by some sort of service.  

An example of such a service could be an IRC bot that sits in a channel and posts links to the site, attributing those links to the owner based on the nick.

Another example could be a bot that sits in a Skype group chat, harvesting links and attributing them to the user who posted the link in the channel.  

These links can be discussed, upvoted, down voted and commented on.

# TODO

The Threaded library currently prints out the comments, rather than returning them, which is terrible.  It was built as a prototype and should never have made it this far - it should be re-written.  My apologies :(
